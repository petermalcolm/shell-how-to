# Example 1:

 find DRMS -type f -name "*.md" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -e 's#/images/cuc/CUC_Chart#/wp-content/uploads/cuc/CUC_Chart#g'

# Example 2:

 find . -type f -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -e 's/foo/bar/g'


# From https://superuser.com/questions/428493/how-can-i-do-a-recursive-find-and-replace-from-the-command-line
# Here's how it works:
#
# 1.   find . -type f -name '*.txt' finds, in the current directory (.) and below, all regular files (-type f) whose names end in .txt
#
# 2.   | passes the output of that command (a list of filenames) to the next command
#
# 3.   xargs gathers up those filenames and hands them one by one to sed
#
# 4.   sed -i '' -e 's/foo/bar/g' means "edit the file in place, without a backup, and make the following substitution (s/foo/bar) multiple times per line (/g)" (see man sed)
#
# Note that the 'without a backup' part in line 4 is OK for me, because the files I'm changing are under version control anyway, so I can easily undo if there was a mistake.
