    awk 'FNR==NR{a[$1]=$2;next}{$1=a[$1]}1' lookup.txt file1

Explanation:

# true as long as we are reading the first file, lookup.txt
FNR==NR {
    # create a lookup array 'a' indexed by field 1 of lookup txt
    a[$1]=$2
    # don't process further actions
    next
}

# because of the 'next' statement above, this will be only executed
# when we are processing the second file, file1
{
    # translate field 1. use the value from the lookup array
    $1=a[$1]
}

# always true. print the line
1
