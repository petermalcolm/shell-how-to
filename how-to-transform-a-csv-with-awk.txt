# Use the delimiter (-F,)
# Use variables (pl, pr, q, c) for (left-paren, right-paren, quote, comma) respectively

# Remember, $0 is the entire string
# $1, $2, $3 ... are the parsed tokens

# Note: The final token sometimes "wraps" to the beginning with \r
# This is annoying and confusing, but you can deal with it by 
# piping to tr
# | tr -d "\r"

# sample usage
tildecommafile CPT_2022_CONTENT_WITH_RVUS/LONGULT.csv| head -n3 | awk -F, -v pl='(' -v pr=')' -v q='"' -v c=',' '{print pl q $1 q c pr}'


# sample output
